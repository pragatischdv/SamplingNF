# Sampling of supervised datasets using Normalizing flows

The datasets in all the files are compressed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and sampled set are not being reconstructed to original form which can be done as future work if one wishes to work with sampled data. This repository only contains the code that calculates the accuracy of sampled data for supervised dataset.
